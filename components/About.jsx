          FOSSMEC is the Free and Open Source Software Cell of Government Model
          Engineering College. The cell was formed to organize the collegeâ€™s
          technical initiatives under a single, structured platform and to
          actively promote free open source culture. It brings together students
          passionate about technology to work on projects, contribute to global
          free open source communities, and explore real-world tools and
          workflows. Through workshops, hands-on sessions, and events, we
          encourage learning, collaboration, and contribution to the broader
          free open source ecosystem both within the college and beyond.
